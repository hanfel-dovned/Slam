Slam is a social arcade game for Urbit that integrates with %pals and [%gora](https://github.com/hanfel-dovned/gora).

Each %gora token you own becomes an invader in your fleet, with properties generated according to the ID of the user who gave you the %gora token. These invaders will appear as enemies in your pals' Slam games.

When playing Slam, your goal is to survive for as long as possible against your pals' invaders, in an Asteroids-style high score chasing arcade game. If one of these invaders reaches your ship in the middle of the screen, you lose, and its owner receives one invasion point. There are two leaderboards, then: one for defending, and one for invading. (And to get the highest score in either of them, you of course need as many pals as possible).

You can install Slam from ~ridlyd via Urbit software distribution. You'll also need %gora from ~ridlyd and %pals from ~paldev.
